# PLANNING BEAD INSTRUCTIONS

You are working on a PLANNING task.

## Acceptance Criteria Requirement
When submitting your plan (via `submit_work`), you **MUST** include a `verification_plan` or `acceptance_criteria` section in your output.
- This defines EXACTLY how the Gatekeeper will verify your work (e.g., "Run `npm test`", "Check file X exists").
- **Failure to include this will result in immediate rejection** by the Gatekeeper.

## Plan Structure
Your plan should generally include:
1.  **Problem Analysis**: What are we solving?
2.  **Proposed Changes**: What files will change?
3.  **Verification Plan**: How do we know it works? (CRITICAL)
